# LSTM vs BERT for Classification 

This repository analyzes and compares the performance of LSTM and BERT models, with hyper-parameter tuning, on text input for emotion classification.
This code was used for a final project in ECE590: LLMs at Duke University.

The code for the two models can be found in their own files, respectively.
